# Code Challenge

Your task is to work with someone else at your table to define a method called `merge(array1, array2)` that is called with two **sorted** arrays. It should return a single array that contains all the elements of both arrays in sorted order.

Ex:

```ruby
merge([3,6,12,24], [-10, 0, 10, 100])
# => [-10, 0, 3, 6, 10, 12, 24, 100]

merge([2,3,4,5], [1])
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Remember, you can assume the two input arrays given to your method will always be in sorted order.
